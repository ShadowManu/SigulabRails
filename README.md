This project is part of Universidad Simón Bolívar's PS1115 Informatin Systems course. It's a CRUD and management application for resources of the Laboratory Unit F of the University.

Initially authored in April, 2015. This project is discontinued and I won't provide support for building the app, given how old and messy it grew in its time. Left as is, use as you wish (MIT Licensed).
